## 1. Comparison: Flat File Systems vs. Relational Databases
The table below compares Flat File Systems and Relational Databases based on several important characteristics:

| Feature           | Flat File Systems                         | Relational Databases                      |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Structure**     | Stores data in plain text files, typically one table per file. | Organized into tables with defined schemas (columns, data types). |
| **Data Redundancy** | High redundancy due to duplication in separate files. | Minimal redundancy using primary/foreign keys. |
| **Relationships**  | No relationships between data entries.   | Strong support for relationships via keys. |
| **Example Usage**  | Simple Excel/CSV files, small local data storage. | Business systems, web applications, CRMs. |
| **Drawbacks**      | Difficult to manage, lacks data integrity, prone to inconsistency. | More complex to set up but offers scalability and consistency. |
